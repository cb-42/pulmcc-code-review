```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This is a brief example using simulated (though realistic) sample names and generates several metadata columns with `tidyr::extract`. More examples to follow.

```{r metadata_extraction}
sample_names <- paste0(paste0("LMB21_Feces_D", c(1,4,7,10,14)), "_M", rep(c(1:5), each=5))

meta_df <- sample_names %>%
  data.frame(Sample_name = .) %>%
  tidyr::extract(col = Sample_name, into = c("Experiment", "Tissue", "Day", "Mouse"), 
          regex = "([[:alnum:]]+)_([[:alnum:]]+)_([[:alnum:]]+)_([[:alnum:]]+)")
```
